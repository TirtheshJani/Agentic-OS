# Scientific Writing

## Overview

**This is the core skill for the deep research and writing tool**. It combines AI-driven deep research with well-formatted written outputs. Every document produced is backed by comprehensive literature search and verified citations through the research-lookup skill.

Scientific writing is a process for communicating research with precision and clarity. Write manuscripts using IMRAD structure, citations (APA/AMA/Vancouver), figures/tables, and reporting guidelines (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA). Apply this skill for research papers and journal submissions.

**Critical Principle: Always write in full paragraphs with flowing prose. Never submit bullet points in the final manuscript.** Use a two-stage process: first create section outlines with key points using research-lookup, then convert those outlines into complete paragraphs.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:
- Writing or revising any section of a scientific manuscript (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion)
- Structuring a research paper using IMRAD or other standard formats
- Formatting citations and references in specific styles (APA, AMA, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE)
- Creating, formatting, or improving figures, tables, and data visualizations
- Applying study-specific reporting guidelines (CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for reviews)
- Drafting abstracts that meet journal requirements (structured or unstructured)
- Preparing manuscripts for submission to specific journals
- Improving writing clarity, conciseness, and precision
- Ensuring proper use of field-specific terminology and nomenclature
- Addressing reviewer comments and revising manuscripts

## Visual Enhancement

<!-- TODO: vendor scientific-schematics skill -->
<!-- TODO: vendor generate-image skill -->

Every scientific paper should include a graphical abstract plus 1-2 additional figures. Once the companion image-generation skills are vendored into this repo, this section will document how to invoke them; until then, draft figure intent in the manuscript outline and produce the figures manually.

**Recommended figure counts:**

| Document Type | Minimum | Recommended |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Research Papers | 5 | 6-8 |
| Literature Reviews | 4 | 5-7 |
| Market Research | 20 | 25-30 |
| Presentations | 1/slide | 1-2/slide |
| Posters | 6 | 8-10 |
| Grants | 4 | 5-7 |
| Clinical Reports | 3 | 4-6 |

Use technical diagrams for: study-design flowcharts (CONSORT, PRISMA, STROBE), conceptual frameworks, experimental workflows, analysis pipelines, biological pathway diagrams, system architectures, neural net architectures, decision trees, comparison matrices, timelines. Use photorealistic illustrations for medical/anatomical content, environmental/ecological scenes, equipment, lab setups, infographics, cover graphics.

When in doubt: complex concept gets a schematic, data discussion gets a visualization, process gets a flowchart, comparison gets a comparison diagram.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Manuscript Structure and Organization

**IMRAD Format**: Guide papers through the standard Introduction, Methods, Results, And Discussion structure used across most scientific disciplines. This includes:
- **Introduction**: Establish research context, identify gaps, state objectives
- **Methods**: Detail study design, populations, procedures, and analysis approaches
- **Results**: Present findings objectively without interpretation
- **Discussion**: Interpret results, acknowledge limitations, propose future directions

For detailed guidance on IMRAD structure, refer to `references/imrad_structure.md`.

**Alternative Structures**: Support discipline-specific formats including:
- Review articles (narrative, systematic, scoping)
- Case reports and case series
- Meta-analyses and pooled analyses
- Theoretical/modeling papers
- Methods papers and protocols

### 2. Section-Specific Writing Guidance

**Abstract Composition**: Craft concise, standalone summaries (100-250 words) that capture the paper's purpose, methods, results, and conclusions. Support both structured abstracts (with labeled sections) and unstructured single-paragraph formats.

**Introduction Development**: Build compelling introductions that:
- Establish the research problem's importance
- Review relevant literature systematically
- Identify knowledge gaps or controversies
- State clear research questions or hypotheses
- Explain the study's novelty and significance

**Methods Documentation**: Ensure reproducibility through:
- Detailed participant/sample descriptions
- Clear procedural documentation
- Statistical methods with justification
- Equipment and materials specifications
- Ethical approval and consent statements

**Results Presentation**: Present findings with:
- Logical flow from primary to secondary outcomes
- Integration with figures and tables
- Statistical significance with effect sizes
- Objective reporting without interpretation

**Discussion Construction**: Synthesize findings by:
- Relating results to research questions
- Comparing with existing literature
- Acknowledging limitations honestly
- Proposing mechanistic explanations
- Suggesting practical implications and future research

### 3. Citation and Reference Management

Apply citation styles correctly across disciplines. For comprehensive style guides, refer to `references/citation_styles.md`.

**Major Citation Styles:**
- **AMA (American Medical Association)**: Numbered superscript citations, common in medicine
- **Vancouver**: Numbered citations in square brackets, biomedical standard
- **APA (American Psychological Association)**: Author-date in-text citations, common in social sciences
- **Chicago**: Notes-bibliography or author-date, humanities and sciences
- **IEEE**: Numbered square brackets, engineering and computer science

**Best Practices:**
- Cite primary sources when possible
- Include recent literature (last 5-10 years for active fields)
- Balance citation distribution across introduction and discussion
- Verify all citations against original sources
- Use reference management software (Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote)

### 4. Figures and Tables

Create effective data visualizations that enhance comprehension. For detailed best practices, refer to `references/figures_tables.md`.

**When to Use Tables vs. Figures:**
- **Tables**: Precise numerical data, complex datasets, multiple variables requiring exact values
- **Figures**: Trends, patterns, relationships, comparisons best understood visually

**Design Principles:**
- Make each table/figure self-explanatory with complete captions
- Use consistent formatting and terminology across all display items
- Label all axes, columns, and rows with units
- Include sample sizes (n) and statistical annotations
- Follow the "one table/figure per 1000 words" guideline
- Avoid duplicating information between text, tables, and figures

**Common Figure Types:**
- Bar graphs: Comparing discrete categories
- Line graphs: Showing trends over time
- Scatterplots: Displaying correlations
- Box plots: Showing distributions and outliers
- Heatmaps: Visualizing matrices and patterns

### 5. Reporting Guidelines by Study Type

Ensure completeness and transparency by following established reporting standards. For comprehensive guideline details, refer to `references/reporting_guidelines.md`.

**Key Guidelines:**
- **CONSORT**: Randomized controlled trials
- **STROBE**: Observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional)
- **PRISMA**: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- **STARD**: Diagnostic accuracy studies
- **TRIPOD**: Prediction model studies
- **ARRIVE**: Animal research
- **CARE**: Case reports
- **SQUIRE**: Quality improvement studies
- **SPIRIT**: Study protocols for clinical trials
- **CHEERS**: Economic evaluations

Each guideline provides checklists ensuring all critical methodological elements are reported.

### 6. Writing Principles and Style

Apply fundamental scientific writing principles. For detailed guidance, refer to `references/writing_principles.md`.

**Clarity**:
- Use precise, unambiguous language
- Define technical terms and abbreviations at first use
- Maintain logical flow within and between paragraphs
- Use active voice when appropriate for clarity

**Conciseness**:
- Eliminate redundant words and phrases
- Favor shorter sentences (15-20 words average)
- Remove unnecessary qualifiers
- Respect word limits strictly

**Accuracy**:
- Report exact values with appropriate precision
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Distinguish between observations and interpretations
- Acknowledge uncertainty appropriately

**Objectivity**:
- Present results without bias
- Avoid overstating findings or implications
- Acknowledge conflicting evidence
- Maintain professional, neutral tone

### 7. Writing Process: From Outline to Full Paragraphs

**CRITICAL: Always write in full paragraphs, never submit bullet points in scientific papers.**

Use a two-stage approach: (1) gather literature with [research-lookup](../research-lookup/SKILL.md) and draft a bulleted outline with main arguments, key citations, and logical flow; (2) expand each bullet into complete sentences with transitions, naturally integrated citations, and varied sentence structure. Bullet points are scaffolding only and must not appear in the final manuscript except in Methods (inclusion/exclusion criteria, materials) and Supplementary Materials.

The abstract must always be flowing prose, never labeled sections (Background:/Methods:/Results:/Conclusions:), unless the target journal explicitly requires structured format.

See [references/outline_to_prose.md](references/outline_to_prose.md) for worked examples (outline of an Introduction section, prose conversion), a comparison table of outline vs. final text, common mistakes to avoid, and details on when lists are acceptable.

### 8. Professional Report Formatting (Non-Journal Documents)

For research reports, technical reports, white papers, and other professional documents that are NOT journal manuscripts, use the `scientific_report.sty` LaTeX style package for a polished, professional appearance.

**When to use:** research reports, technical reports, white papers, policy briefs, grant reports, internal research summaries, feasibility studies.

**When NOT to use:** journal manuscripts and conference papers should follow venue-specific formatting; academic theses should follow institutional templates.

See [references/professional_report_formatting.md](references/professional_report_formatting.md) for the full breakdown of:
- Style package features (typography, color scheme, box environments, tables, figures, scientific commands)
- Box environments (`keyfindings`, `methodology`, `recommendations`, `limitations`)
- Professional table formatting with `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule`, alternating row colors
- Scientific notation commands (`\pvalue`, `\CI`, `\effectsize`, `\samplesize`, `\meansd`, significance stars)
- Getting started template and XeLaTeX compilation instructions

Companion assets in `assets/`: `scientific_report.sty`, `scientific_report_template.tex`, `REPORT_FORMATTING_GUIDE.md`.

### 9. Journal-Specific Formatting

Adapt manuscripts to journal requirements:
- Follow author guidelines for structure, length, and format
- Apply journal-specific citation styles
- Meet figure/table specifications (resolution, file formats, dimensions)
- Include required statements (funding, conflicts of interest, data availability, ethical approval)
- Adhere to word limits for each section
- Format according to template requirements when provided

### 10. Field-Specific Language and Terminology

Adapt language, terminology, and conventions to match the specific scientific discipline. Each field has established vocabulary, preferred phrasings, and domain-specific conventions that signal expertise and ensure clarity for the target audience.

See [references/field_specific_terminology.md](references/field_specific_terminology.md) for the full per-discipline breakdown across biomedical and clinical sciences, molecular biology and genetics, chemistry and pharmaceutical sciences, ecology and environmental sciences, physics and engineering, neuroscience, and social and behavioral sciences, plus general principles (audience expertise, term definition strategy, consistency, avoiding field-mixing errors, and verifying terminology usage).

### 11. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Top Rejection Reasons:**
1. Inappropriate, incomplete, or insufficiently described statistics
2. Over-interpretation of results or unsupported conclusions
3. Poorly described methods affecting reproducibility
4. Small, biased, or inappropriate samples
5. Poor writing quality or difficult-to-follow text
6. Inadequate literature review or context
7. Figures and tables that are unclear or poorly designed
8. Failure to follow reporting guidelines

**Writing Quality Issues:**
- Mixing tenses inappropriately (use past tense for methods/results, present for established facts)
- Excessive jargon or undefined acronyms
- Paragraph breaks that disrupt logical flow
- Missing transitions between sections
- Inconsistent notation or terminology

## Workflow for Manuscript Development

**Stage 1: Planning**
1. Identify target journal and review author guidelines
2. Determine applicable reporting guideline (CONSORT, STROBE, etc.)
3. Outline manuscript structure (usually IMRAD)
4. Plan figures and tables as the backbone of the paper

**Stage 2: Drafting** (Use two-stage writing process for each section)
1. Start with figures and tables (the core data story)
2. For each section below, follow the two-stage process:
   - **First**: Create outline with bullet points using research-lookup
   - **Second**: Convert bullet points to full paragraphs with flowing prose
3. Write Methods (often easiest to draft first)
4. Draft Results (describing figures/tables objectively)
5. Compose Discussion (interpreting findings)
6. Write Introduction (setting up the research question)
7. Craft Abstract (synthesizing the complete story)
8. Create Title (concise and descriptive)

**Remember**: bullet points are for planning only. The final manuscript must be in complete paragraphs.

**Stage 3: Revision**
1. Check logical flow and "red thread" throughout
2. Verify consistency in terminology and notation
3. Ensure figures/tables are self-explanatory
4. Confirm adherence to reporting guidelines
5. Verify all citations are accurate and properly formatted
6. Check word counts for each section
7. Proofread for grammar, spelling, and clarity

**Stage 4: Final Preparation**
1. Format according to journal requirements
2. Prepare supplementary materials
3. Write cover letter highlighting significance
4. Complete submission checklists
5. Gather all required statements and forms

## Integration with Other Scientific Skills

This skill works effectively with:
- **Data analysis skills**: For generating results to report
- **Statistical analysis**: For determining appropriate statistical presentations
- **Literature review skills**: For contextualizing research
- **Figure creation tools**: For developing publication-quality visualizations
- **scientific_report.sty**: For professional reports, white papers, and technical documents
- [paper-search](../paper-search/SKILL.md), [literature-review](../literature-review/SKILL.md), [research-lookup](../research-lookup/SKILL.md): For evidence gathering

### Professional Reports vs. Journal Manuscripts

<!-- TODO: vendor venue-templates skill for journal/conference formatting -->

| Document Type | Formatting Approach |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Journal manuscripts | Follow target journal author guidelines directly |
| Conference papers | Follow conference template directly |
| Research reports | Use `scientific_report.sty` (this skill) |
| White papers | Use `scientific_report.sty` (this skill) |
| Technical reports | Use `scientific_report.sty` (this skill) |
| Grant reports | Use `scientific_report.sty` (this skill) |

Different venues have dramatically different expectations (Nature/Science: story-driven and broad; Cell Press: mechanistic with graphical abstracts; medical journals: structured abstracts; ML conferences: contribution bullets and ablations; CS conferences: field-specific conventions). Until a venue-templates skill is vendored, consult the target venue's author guidelines and a recent representative paper from the same venue before drafting.
